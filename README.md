#  KLD-Pharmacological_Class_Similarity

Collection of scripts for distinguishing two Pharmacological classes using Kullback-Leibler divergence from Tanimoto Coefficient distribution of each classes. 

### (Requirements)
This script is designed to run under Python 3.6 and Anaconda version 5.2.0

### (usage)
1) Generate pdf (probability density function) driven from Gaussian mixture model(GMM) (Using GMM.ipynb)
	: The pdf represents each of pharmacological classes

2) Calculate and Visualize Kullback-Leibler Divergence of Pharmacological Class(64+64, 64+10003, 10003+10003)  from gaussian mixture pdfs 
	 (Using KLD.ipynb)
   
### (Result)
 The final result form KL-divergence works as an informatical comparison method that characterizes the structures of 3D-similarity scores.
